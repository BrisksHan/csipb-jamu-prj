TODO
> handle invalid gram's element (gp does not guarantee: [0,1)), 
scaling? invalidate data?
scale the gram matrix to be in (0,1]

> set convergence threshold
> try another evo algorithm, besides easimple()
> precompute a,b,c,d, for further speed-up?

DONE
--> use random.seed(seed)
use both random.seed() and numpy.random.seed()
--> use FitnessMulti
should be avoided, not really know how it works
--> use standard evo algorithm provided in deap
--> how to normalize rank of nRecall
same individuals should get same scores
use scipy.stats.percentileofscore? only from unique individual
--> who validates fitness (set fitness.valid=TRUE) after fitness calculation?
validate by filling it with values
invalidate if len(fitness.values)==0
--> keep random's seed for later reproduction
--> paralel fitness calculation using scoop, try first with getInRangeFitness
--> log per generation
--> add zero-div fitness
--> save logbook
--> handle out-of-memory!
remove element in dict, use del
--> solve gramTr vs gramTe in svm scikit-learn
--> try other metrics: precision, recall, fscore
--> what if rankRecall is not independent?
percetileRank should be after independent test
recallFitness is set to min
--> for zoo
run 100 runs with 100 genMax with 100 individuals
--> preprocess/reduce dataset jamu
--> fix racall fitness, to rank directly the percentile, (canceled)
