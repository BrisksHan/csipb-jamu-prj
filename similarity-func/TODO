remove element in dict, use dict.pop()

DONE
--> use random.seed(seed)
use both random.seed() and numpy.random.seed()
--> use FitnessMulti
should be avoided, not really know how it works
--> use standard evo algorithm provided in deap
--> how to normalize rank of nRecall
same individuals should get same scores
use scipy.stats.percentileofscore? only from unique individual
--> who validates fitness (set fitness.valid=TRUE) after fitness calculation?
validate by filling it with values
invalidate if len(fitness.values)==0
--> keep random's seed for later reproduction
--> paralel fitness calculation using scoop, try first with getInRangeFitness
--> log per generation
--> add zero-div fitness
--> save logbook
