> For these problems, should we:
filter individual after mutation and crossover?
modify the fitness function?
increase the minimum tree depth?
>> GPSimFunc may return score>1.0, e.g. add(a,d)
>> If we use pure division, then GPSimFunc may have zero division. e.g. div(a,d)

> Focusing on tanimoto vs GPSimFunc, 
>> there are 3 scenarios in terms of individuals in gen-0:
   all random, some random and some tanimoto, all tanimoto
>> should we break the tie for the same fitness?

> Some requirements for distance functions are:
