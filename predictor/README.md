# Compound-protein connectivity prediction

## Aliases and Keywords
* drug-target prediction
* drug-target interactions (DTI) prediction
* compound-protein interaction (CPI) prediction
* drug discovery
* drug-target network
* in-silico drug screening
* virtual drug screening
* computational screening
* compound-protein link prediction

## Challenges
* imbalanced data, highly skewed datasets: small number of positive samples (known interactions)
    * current solution: use of local training data to help reduce irrelevant data,
      so each compound-protein has its own model/classifier, this is surely computationally expensive
* deceptive negative samples as they can be either trully negative or simply unknown (not yet clinically/chemical tested)
    * validated negative samples are not available;
      people never report negative results after clinical/chemical experiment
    * this may fool the machine during learning in that
      _almost_ positive interactions but _unknown_ are considered the same as _truly_ negative ones
* handle 4 scenarios: (new: having no existing/known interaction)
    * Known drug, known target
    * New drug, known target
    * Known drug, new target
    * New drug, new target (hardest)
* features of compound-protein interactions (on chemical, genomic and pharmacological spaces)
    * which features are mostly relevant, sufficient, ...
    * feature extraction
* similarity (kernel) functions (on chemical, genomic and pharmacological spaces)
