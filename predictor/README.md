# Compound-protein connectivity prediction

## Aliases and Keywords
* drug-target prediction
* drug-target interactions (DTI) prediction
* compound-protein interaction (CPI) prediction
* drug discovery
* drug-target network
* in-silico drug screening
* virtual drug screening
* computational screening
* compound-protein link prediction

## Challenges
* imbalanced data, highly skewed datasets: small number of positive samples (known interactions)
    * validated negative samples are not available, so negative samples can be either trully negative or unknown
    * current solution: use of local training data to help reduce irrelevant data,
      so each compound-protein has its own model/classifiser, this is surely computationally expensive
* accomodating 4 scenarios: (new: having no existing/known interaction)
    * Known drug, known target
    * New drug, known target
    * Known drug, new target
    * New drug, new target (hardest)
* features of compound-protein interaction (on chemical, genomic and pharmacological spaces)
    * which features are mostly relevant, sufficient, ...
    * feature extraction
* similarity (kernel) functions (on chemical, genomic and pharmacological spaces)
