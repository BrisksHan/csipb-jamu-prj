# Compound-protein connectivity prediction

## Aliases and Keywords
* drug-target prediction
* drug-target interactions (DTI) prediction
* compound-protein interaction (CPI) prediction
* drug discovery
* drug-target network
* in-silico drug screening
* virtual drug screening
* computational screening
* compound-protein link prediction

## Challenges
* small number of positive samples (known interactions); imbalanced data
* validated negative samples are not available, so negative samples can be either trully negative or unknown
* prediction of interaction for new drugs / novel target proteins, (new: having no existing/known interaction)
* use of local model (local training data) is computationally demanding, moreover in production
* accomodating 4 scenarios:
    * Known drug, known target
    * New drug, known target
    * Known drug, new target
    * New drug, new target
