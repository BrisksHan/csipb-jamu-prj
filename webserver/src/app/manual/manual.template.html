<b>Input Data:</b><br />
The Ijah webserver takes as input,
plants (or compounds) in the drug-side and disease (or proteins) in the target-side.
<!-- It accomodates 3 use cases as follows. -->
<!-- \textbf{Use-case 1:}
having plants (or compounds) and diseases (or proteins),
users want to know 3 things:
a)~which compounds are contained in those plants (or which plants contain those compounds),
b)~which proteins are associated with those disease (or which diseases are associated with such proteins), and
c)~the interaction among those compounds and proteins, for which Ijah gives both factual and predicted results.\\
\textbf{Use-case 2:}
having only plants (or compounds),
users want to know:
a)~which compounds are contained in those plants (or which plants contains those compounds) and
b)~top-$n$ proteins based on the degree of interactions with those compounds, along with diseases associated with those proteins.\\
\textbf{Use-case 3:}
having only diseases (or proteins),
users want to know:
a)~which proteins are associated with those diseases (or which diseases are associated with such proteins), and
b)~\mbox{top-$n$} compounds based on the degree of interactions with those proteins, along with plants containing those compounds.
The Ijah webserver also accomodates command-line and programming interface in order to allow
programmatic access for rapid and efficient data retrieval. -->
